# Embedded Systems Engineering Student
I am an embedded systems engineering student at UPSSITECH, currently working on the [TLSE-Racing](https://tlseracing.fr/about/) international autonomous Formula 1 project in collaboration with ISAE-SUPAERO.

##  Projects

### [Trajectory generation on robot manipulator RX160](https://github.com/OlivierCrt/Trajectory_Generation_Robot_Manipulator_RX160)
- **Description**: RRR robot model, including modeling parameters, simulations, and associated tests. It enables geometric and kinematic modeling calculations, as well as trajectory simulations.
### [MoBotSim - Mobile Robot Simulation](https://github.com/OlivierCrt/MobotSim)
- **Description**: Simulation of a mobile robot, providing functionalities for image analysis, text command processing, and robot movement simulation in a virtual environment.
### [MoBot](https://github.com/OlivierCrt/Mobot)
- **Description**: Mobile robot software,that aims to analyse a space and track objects using speech recognition.
### [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/OlivierCrt/Reinforcement_Learning)
- **Description**: Implementation of Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, and Epsilon-Greedy algorithms.
### [Les pirates](https://github.com/OlivierCrt/les_pirates)
- **Description**: Object-oriented programming. Video game inspired by the french "Jeu de l'oie".
