# Embedded Systems Engineering Student

**Student at [UPSSITECH](https://www.upssitech.eu/)**, currently working on the **[TLSE-Racing](https://tlseracing.fr/about/)** international autonomous Formula 1 project in collaboration with **ISAE-SUPAERO**.



##  Internship 

I completed my internship at **[AIST](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html)**, Japanâ€™s lead AI research institute where I worked in the field of robot learning.

During my internship, I developed a sim-to-real workflow involving a robot and a camera for 6D object pose estimation used in grasping tasks.
I designed a custom C++ controller that allows flexible editing of trajectory parameters, and built a complete simulation environment in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

Using this setup, I trained RL agents in simulation and successfully deployed them to the real robot, achieving a 100% success rate in grasp-and-lift tasks.

You can find part of my work on my **[AIST GitHub profile](https://github.com/Olivier-AIST)** including my custom controller and  simulator (other projects remain private).

Supervisor: Erich Floris, Team leader at AIST
